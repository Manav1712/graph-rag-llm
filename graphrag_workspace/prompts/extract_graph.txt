-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [concept, person, school of thought, technology, sectors, investment strategies, organization, physical system, physical property, physical law, mathematical model, measurement unit, physical quantity, scientific principle, research method, physical phenomenon, scientific theory, experimental technique, physical constant, scientific equipment]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

In addition to the entity types, **ALWAYS extract the fundamental concepts of physics (e.g., ENERGY, MATTER, FORCE, MASS, MOMENTUM, WORK, POWER, LAW OF CONSERVATION, etc.) if they appear anywhere in the text, regardless of context.

The term deceleration can cause confusion in our analysis because it is not 
a vector and it does not point to a specific direction with respect to a 
coordinate system, so we do not use it. Acceleration is a vector, so we must 
choose the appropriate sign for it in our chosen coordinate system. In the 
case of the train in [link], acceleration is in the negative direction in the 
chosen coordinate system, so we say the train is undergoing negative 
acceleration. 


If an object in motion has a velocity in the positive direction with respect to 
a chosen origin and it acquires a constant negative acceleration, the object 


eventually comes to a rest and reverses direction. If we wait long enough, 


the object passes through the origin going in the opposite direction. This is 
illustrated in [link].

An object in motion with a velocity vector toward the east under 
negative acceleration comes to a rest and reverses direction. It passes 
the origin going in the opposite direction after a long enough time. 


Example: 
Calculating Average Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate 


A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of 
15.0 m/s due west in 1.80 s. What is its average acceleration?

modification of work by Jon Sullivan) 


Strategy 

First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem 
[link]. This is a simple problem, but it always helps to visualize it. Notice 
that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we 


have negative velocity. 
oS N (+y) 
Vv; = —15.0 m/s Vo = 


W (-x) E (+x) 
a=? S (-y) 


Identify the coordinate system, the given information, and what you 
want to determine. 


We can solve this problem by identifying Av and At from the given 
information, and then calculating the average acceleration directly from the 


equationa = 4% = ae 


Solution 

First, identify the knowns: vp = 0, vg = —15.0 m/s (the negative sign 
indicates direction toward the west), At = 1.80 s. 

Second, find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to — 
15.0 m/s, its change in velocity equals its final velocity: 

Equation: 


Av = v¢ — Up = Up = —15.0 m/s. 


Last, substitute the known values (Av and At) and solve for the unknown 
i: 
Equation: 


Significance 

The negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the 
west. An acceleration of 8.33 m/s” due west means the horse increases its 
velocity by 8.33 m/s due west each second; that is, 8.33 meters per second 
per second, which we write as 8.33 m/s’. This is truly an average 
acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We see later that an 
acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a 
force nearly equal to his weight. 


Note: 
Exercise: 


Problem: 


Check Your Understanding Protons in a linear accelerator are 
accelerated from rest to 2.0 x 10’ m/s in 10“ s. What is the average 
acceleration of the protons? 


Solution: 


Inserting the knowns, we have 


~ Ay _ 2.0x10"m/s—0 __ 11 2 
a = ee m/s’. 


Instantaneous Acceleration 


Instantaneous acceleration a, or acceleration at a specific instant in time, is 
obtained using the same process discussed for instantaneous velocity. That 
is, we calculate the average acceleration between two points in time 
separated by Aé and let At approach zero. The result is the derivative of 
the velocity function v(t), which is instantaneous acceleration and is 
expressed mathematically as 


Note: 
Equation: 


Thus, similar to velocity being the derivative of the position function, 
instantaneous acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. We can 
show this graphically in the same way as instantaneous velocity. In [link], 
instantaneous acceleration at time fo is the slope of the tangent line to the 
velocity-versus-time graph at time tp. We see that average acceleration 

a= Me approaches instantaneous acceleration as At approaches zero. 


Also in part (a) of the figure, we see that velocity has a maximum when its 
slope is zero. This time corresponds to the zero of the acceleration function. 
In part (b), instantaneous acceleration at the minimum velocity is shown, 
which is also zero, since the slope of the curve is zero there, too. Thus, for a 
given velocity function, the zeros of the acceleration function give either 
the minimum or the maximum velocity. 


a(tg) = slope of tangent line a(ty) = slope of tangent line 


Velocity 


In a graph of velocity versus time, instantaneous acceleration is the 
slope of the tangent line. (a) Shown is average acceleration 
= Av UE—Uj 


= A = Get between times At = tg — t, At = ts — te, and 


At = t4 — t3. When At —> 0, the average acceleration approaches 
instantaneous acceleration at time to. In view (a), instantaneous 
acceleration is shown for the point on the velocity curve at maximum

Glossary 


closed system 
system for which the mass is constant and the net external force on the 
system is zero 


Law of Conservation of Momentum 
total momentum of a closed system cannot change 


system 
object or collection of objects whose motion is currently under 
investigation; however, your system is defined at the start of the problem, 
you must keep that definition for the entire problem 


Types of Collisions 
By the end of this section, you will be able to: 


e Identify the type of collision 

e Correctly label a collision as elastic or inelastic 

e Use kinetic energy along with momentum and impulse to analyze a 
collision 


Although momentum is conserved in all interactions, not all interactions 
(collisions or explosions) are the same. The possibilities include: 


e A single object can explode into multiple objects (one-to-many). 

¢ Multiple objects can collide and stick together, forming a single object 
(many-to-one). 

¢ Multiple objects can collide and bounce off of each other, remaining as 
multiple objects (many-to-many). If they do bounce off each other, 
then they may recoil at the same speeds with which they approached 
each other before the collision, or they may move off more slowly. 


It’s useful, therefore, to categorize different types of interactions, according 
to how the interacting objects move before and after the interaction. 


One-to-Many 


The first possibility is that a single object may break apart into two or more 
pieces. An example of this is a firecracker, or a bow and arrow, or a rocket 
rising through the air toward space. These can be difficult to analyze if the 
number of fragments after the collision is more than about three or four; but 
nevertheless, the total momentum of the system before and after the 
explosion is identical. 


Note that if the object is initially motionless, then the system (which is just 
the object) has no momentum and no kinetic energy. After the explosion, 
the net momentum of all the pieces of the object must sum to zero (since the 
momentum of this closed system cannot change). However, the system will 
have a great deal of kinetic energy after the explosion, although it had none 
before. Thus, we see that, although the momentum of the system is 


conserved in an explosion, the kinetic energy of the system most definitely 
is not; it increases. This interaction—one object becoming many, with an 
increase of kinetic energy of the system—is called an explosion. 


Where does the energy come from? Does conservation of energy still hold? 
Yes; some form of potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. In the 
case of gunpowder burning and pushing out a bullet, chemical potential 
energy is converted to kinetic energy of the bullet, and of the recoiling gun. 
For a bow and arrow, it is elastic potential energy in the bowstring. 


Many-to-One 


The second possibility is the reverse: that two or more objects collide with 
each other and stick together, thus (after the collision) forming one single 
composite object. The total mass of this composite object is the sum of the 
masses of the original objects, and the new single object moves with a 
velocity dictated by the conservation of momentum. However, it turns out 
again that, although the total momentum of the system of objects remains 
constant, the kinetic energy doesn’t; but this time, the kinetic energy 
decreases. This type of collision is called inelastic. 


In the extreme case, multiple objects collide, stick together, and remain 
motionless after the collision. Since the objects are all motionless after the 
collision, the final kinetic energy is also zero; the loss of kinetic energy is a 
maximum. Such a collision is said to be perfectly inelastic. 


Many-to-Many 


The extreme case on the other end is if two or more objects approach each 
other, collide, and bounce off each other, moving away from each other at 
the same relative speed at which they approached each other. In this case, 
the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. Such an interaction is 
called elastic. 


In any interaction of a closed system of objects, the total momentum of the 
system is conserved (py = pj) but the kinetic energy may not be: 


e If0 < K¢ < K;j, the collision is inelastic. 

e If A; = 0, the collision is perfectly inelastic. 
e If Kk, = K;, the collision is elastic. 

e If As > K;, the interaction is an explosion. 


The point of all this is that, in analyzing a collision or explosion, you can 
use both momentum and kinetic energy.
