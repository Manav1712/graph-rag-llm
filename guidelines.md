GraphRAG QA System: Single-Agent Implementation Guide
Overview
Goal:
Develop a robust QA system over Physics 2e and College Algebra content using Microsoft’s GraphRAG. The system uses a single, intelligent agent that leverages both knowledge graph reasoning (GraphRAG) and baseline vector retrieval (Vector RAG), dynamically selecting the best method to answer each user query.

Highlights:

Single-agent design: All query handling, retrieval, and response generation is encapsulated in one agent for simplicity and extensibility.

Emphasis on knowledge graph quality: Strong focus on entity extraction, graph construction, and meaningful community detection.

Automatic routing: The agent decides when to use GraphRAG (for complex, cross-cutting questions) or baseline Vector RAG (for local, factoid queries).

Modular codebase: Each step (chunking, extraction, graph building, search, evaluation) is cleanly separated for future extension.

4. Key Concepts
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Uses embeddings to retrieve relevant chunks for LLM QA.

Knowledge Graphs: Nodes = entities/concepts; Edges = relationships.

Community Detection (Leiden): Partitions graph into meaningful clusters (“themes”) for scalable summarization and retrieval.

Single Agent: All reasoning, routing, and response generation in one agent class.

5. Implementation Phases & Time Estimates
Phase	Estimate	Focus Area
Knowledge Graph	4 h	Entity extraction, graph building, communities (PRIMARY FOCUS)
Vector RAG Baseline	1 h	Embedding-based retrieval (baseline)
GraphRAG Search	2 h	Global search, knowledge graph use
Single Agent Logic	2 h	Agent with dynamic routing
Demo & Testing	1 h	End-to-end validation

Total: 10 hours

class GraphRAGAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vector_rag = VectorRAG()
        self.graph_rag = GraphRAG()
        self.knowledge_graph = KnowledgeGraph()

    def answer_query(self, query):
        if self.is_complex_query(query):
            return self.graph_rag.search(query)
        else:
            return self.vector_rag.search(query)

    def is_complex_query(self, query):
        # Simple heuristics (customize as needed)
        return len(query.split()) > 10 or any(word in query.lower() 
                for word in ['compare', 'explain', 'summarize', 'relationship'])
                
7. Key Simplifications & Focus Areas
No multi-agent orchestration: Only a single agent, no manager/worker/hand-off logic.

Evaluation harness, advanced guardrails, and visualization are optional/future work.

Main focus:

High-quality, robust knowledge graph (entity/relationship extraction, validation)

Meaningful community detection and summaries

Working global GraphRAG search integrated with the agent

Simple, effective agent routing logic

In summary:
You are delivering a single-agent, graph-based RAG QA system with robust KG extraction and community structure. The agent dynamically chooses between GraphRAG and baseline RAG, making the system simple, transparent, and easy to extend.


**Total Base: 10–11 h; Stretch/Future: up to 16 h.**
